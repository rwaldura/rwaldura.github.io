Dear Genentech:

I am a smart and talented software engineer with eleven years of experience 
in the full software development lifecycle. Designing and building robust
applications that meet users' needs is my primary area of expertise.

My resume will give you an overview of my skills and work experience. You 
will notice I have worked both in industry and academia, with many different
technologies. I believe this broad experience, combined with excellent 
technical skills, make me the ideal candidate for a Senior Architect position 
at Genentech Research.

Why Genentech Research? I have a strong desire to pursue my professional 
development at a company that furthers scientific progress and applies itself 
to health issues. Genentech's commitment and success in those areas has been 
demonstrated many times over.

I look forward to hearing from you,

--Renaud Waldura
