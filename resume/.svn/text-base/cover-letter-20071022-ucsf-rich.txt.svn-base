Dear UCSF: 

My current appointment to the Tobacco projects at the UCSF Library has given me the opportunity to prove my technical and organizational skills. In this setting I have managed to establish a working software development process that has delivered consistent quality results, to the benefit of UCSF researchers and the Tobacco Control community at large.

I have come to realize these skills are precisely those required by a "Programmer Analyst IV - Supervisor" position at the CKM. My familiarity with current Library projects, and my good relationships with CKM staff, contribute to making me an ideal candidate for this position.

I look forward to hearing from you,

--Renaud Waldura
