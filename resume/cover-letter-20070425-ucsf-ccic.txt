Dear Cancer Center Informatics Core:

I am currently working at the UCSF Library on the Tobacco projects. 
http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu

My primary duty at the Library is to create, modify and document Web 
applications and databases to access, index and search documents related
to the Tobacco industry. 

A generalist computer technician with a strong XXX in software,



I look forward to hearing from you,
